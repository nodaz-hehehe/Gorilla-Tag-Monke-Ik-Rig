This is a Gorilla tag ik rig I made that includes: 
Gorilla Tag Player Model
Gorilla Tag Player Textures (Fur, Lava, Rock, Ice) (New updated textures)
Customizable Player Colors
NEW GorillaTag name tag text object
How to import the gorilla into a map
Open a Blender Project that has the maps
Go to "File" > "Append"
open the "Gorilla-Tag-IK-Rig.blend" file
Inside, open the "Collections" folder
Choose "Gorilla_IK_Rig"
Then click "Append"
